I have developed a linear regression model to predict house prices. This project is organized as follows: (1) data cleaning; (2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA); (3) LR model optimisation; (4) validation of the RL model; (5) running LR model on test.csv dataset.

"Linear Regression ML Model Predicting House Prices.ipynb" jupyter notebook file containing the code.

"train.csv" csv file containing the train dataset.

"test.csv" csv file containing the test dataset.

"data_description.txt" text file containing description of the data variables.
